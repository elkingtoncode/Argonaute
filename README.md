Argonaute Core
=====================================

What is Argonaute
----------------

Argonaute is the first cryptocurrency to implement the mini-blockchain scheme along with many other innovative features. Argonaute is a fork of the Bitcoin core but the code has been extensively modified and expanded upon. Innovative new features include withdrawal limits and unmalleable transactions. The mini-blockchain scheme alleviates the blockchain bloat problem and therefore allows superior support for micro-transactions and arbitrary data to be stored in the blockchain.

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Argonaute
development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion (if they haven't already).

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see [doc/coding.md](doc/coding.md)) or are
controversial.

Testing
-------

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run (assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`

Every pull request is built for both Windows and Linux on a dedicated server,
and unit and sanity tests are automatically run.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Large changes should have a test plan, and should be tested by somebody other
than the developer who wrote the code.
